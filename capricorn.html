        <p>The mountain goat is the symbol for this sign because of the
          characteristic of the goat to climb higher and higher. Capricorn signs
          are goal oriented and driven to succeed despite all odds. They will
          work long and hard hours toward a goal. Self-disciplined and successful,
          it is no wonder that some of the worldâ€™s greatest scientists, leaders,
          and teachers have been Capricorn.
        </p>
        <p>Achievement is everything to a Capricorn so they tend to take life
          very seriously and are not tolerant of those who do not. They are
          also very good at engaging in mental parrying at a high level. They
          are natural leaders, politicians, mathematicians, and diplomats.
          Capricorn signs tend to guard their hearts closely. To get close to a
          Capricorn may take some time but it is well worth it.
