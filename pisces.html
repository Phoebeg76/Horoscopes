        <p>The fish is the symbol given to this sign, because fish live in a
          secretive and mysterious place. Pisces tend to be daydreamers, often
          dreaming up brilliant ideas and plans which they cannot make a reality.
          They have a happy and vibrant inner life that few get to see. They are
          deeply caring about others and hate to see people become unhappy.
        </p>
        <p>They are dedicated individuals, staying with a job for decades where
          others move from one job to the next and similarly with relationships.
          Others may find Pisces difficult to get to know because they donâ€™t
          often share their underlying passion and compassion. Pisces can be very
          religious which can possibly lead to intolerance.
