        <p>This sign is cool and calm which is why the symbol of the Maiden was
          chosen. Virgo people are mild mannered on the surface, but not underneath.
          Their minds are never quiet; always thinking, calculating, assessing
          and they love making something out of nothing. They tend to be
          detail oriented and like producing something that is not only useful,
          but beautiful and skillful. Virgo donâ€™t mind being alone as long as
          they know that they are appreciated and needed. They are good listeners,
          and are like to help those in need. Their good nature often means they
          are taken advantage of, and often they end up taking on more jobs
          than they should.
        </p>
        <p>Virgo is an Earth sign which means that they love the outdoors.
          Generally, they are not loud or bossy, but are brilliant strategists
          and an asset to any team. However their work will suffer if they take
          on more than they should.
