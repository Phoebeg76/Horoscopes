<div class="result" data-first="sagittarius" data-second="aries">Twin fire signs, you both cherish independence and excitement.
This makes for some incredible joint adventures, but makes it difficult for you both to settle down.
Once you’ve started a relationship, it’s important to set time aside for some more romantic moments, otherwise your continuous adventures may force you back into a platonic partnership.</div>
<div class="result" data-first="sagittarius" data-second="taurus">This partnership may look odd on paper, but it can be very complimentary.
Taurus helps wandering Sagittarius to establish roots, while Sagittarius encourages the Bull to take more risks.
Taurus believes in investing in long-lasting, quality products, whilst Sagittarius is often swept away by impulse. Finding a financial advisor may be key! </div>
<div class="result" data-first="sagittarius" data-second="gemini">When Gemini and Sagittarius come together for a relationship, it’s dynamic and engaging.
These expert communicators will never run out of things to discuss.
As opposite signs, you’re not always compatible, but when you are there is an immediate attraction between you two.
But, since you both love travel and adventure, it may be hard to pin each other down. </div>

<div class="result" data-first="capricorn" data-second="aries">A usually impulsive Aries often craves structure and certainty from a partner, making responsible and protective Capricorn a good match.
It’s a complimentary but demanding pairing.
If calm Capricorn has to continue looking after the unruly Aries, it may father resentment from the usually generous goat.
Aries will need to step up a bit within the relationship, and Capricorn will need to learn when to say “no” to Aries demands.</div>
<div class="result" data-first="capricorn" data-second="taurus">A Taurus and Capricorn pairing is solid as a rock!
You’re both security-seeking signs who love to plant for the future, making for a traditional and family-oriented relationship.
You might forget to live in the moment with all the future-planning, so try to have some spontaneity! </div>
<div class="result" data-first="capricorn" data-second="gemini">These two ambitious signs are pro networkers, and could each talk for hours.
Talkative Gemini has met their match with stoic Capricorn, who’s also comfortable staying silent for long periods of time.
Gemini’s forward-thinking mind-set will either clash or mesh with Capricorn’s old world values.
Middle ground is often difficult to reach, but stay open to compromise! </div>

<div class="result" data-first="aquarius" data-second="aries">Two opinionated signs who can’t help but debate, which can lead to explosions.
Often a complementary and exciting pairing that lends itself to a best friend dynamic more than a romantic one.
Laid-back Aquarius chills out the impulsive Aries, whilst Aries pushes Aquarius to live life more passionately.
While you both love to debate, you also have tempers that can explode unpredictably.</div>
<div class="result" data-first="aquarius" data-second="taurus">Taurus and Aquarius coming together can be passionate but also aggressive!
You are complete opposites, but you can balance each other out when you each play to your strengths.
You’ll need to give each other lots of space and independence to keep this one alive! </div>
<div class="result" data-first="aquarius" data-second="gemini">As fellow truth-seekers, you’re both on a quest to solve life’s mysteries.
You’re both very intellectual and together you can come up with amazing ideas.
Gemini is better at starting the project, whilst Aquarius ensures you both make it to the finish line!
However, your relationship is so intellectual that neither of you are great at dealing with your feelings for each other. </div>

<div class="result" data-first="aquarius" data-second="pisces"></div>
<div class="result" data-first="pisces" data-second="aries">Both Pisces and Aries have their heads up in space, making them imaginative and cerebral.
Sometimes, this makes the pairing dynamic, other times it causes brooding and resentment.
You’re both prone to spells of anger and annoyance, but you know how to cheer the other up.
You collaborate well, as long as your “bad days” don’t overlap! </div>
<div class="result" data-first="pisces" data-second="taurus">An ethereal and dreamy relationship is on the cards for you two.
While this may seem idealistic, it does mean that your heads can get stuck up in the clouds at times.
You each appreciate life’s guilty pleasures, but watch out for excess as you indulge together. </div>
<div class="result" data-first="pisces" data-second="gemini">Both Gemini and Pisces prefer fantasy over reality, and you will quickly become one another’s creative muse.
Both signs are prone to mood swings, so this pairing can be quite an emotional roller coaster!
You’re both dual signs – Gemini is symbolised by the Twins and Pisces by two Fish swimming away from each other.
As a result, it can feel like there’s four people in this relationship – none of whom can make a decision that sticks! </div>
