        <p>Libra people tend to need balance in their lives, so the symbol of the
          scales particularly appropriate for this sign. Libra signs need to keep
          a balance between work and home lives and an equal balance in their
          emotional and spiritual lives. Because of this, Libra signs can sometimes
          seem indecisive. This is because they must consider all of their options.
          However, when a Libra makes up their mind the decision is likely the
          best for all involved. This sign does not like to see people unhappy.
        </p>
        <p>Harmony and peace are what makes this sign happy. This sign is often
          charming and people like to be around them. The only time that they will
          become unhappy is when they think they have been treated unfairly.
          This sign should embrace some form of meditation as it allows them to
          find that internal balance. Most Libra enjoy physical exercise and many
          run marathons.
