        <p>The crab symbolizes this sign. Just as the crab carries its own shell
          on its back, so too, does the typical cancer sign. The typical cancer
          is all about family and is very dedicated and loyal to friends and
          family. Often, if they can avoid a fight, or achieve a goal, then
          moving in alternative directions to arrive at the destination is
          typical. They tend to grasp and hold tightly to things that make them
          happy. The key characteristic of this sign is that they like to be
          needed. They need to know that they matter to someone and that they
          are secure in that love. This sign can be brave, courageous and
          protective, bus also shy, reserved, brooding, and moody if their needs
          are not being met
        </p>
        <p>Cancer is a water sign which means that they have a deep, mysterious
          side to them that can also be gentle and nurturing.
