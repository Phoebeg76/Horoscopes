        <p>This signâ€™s characteristic is to be peaceful and methodical so its
          sign is a bull. Taurus is very deliberate in their actions, and enjoy
          all of the sensual pleasures. Food, drink, sex, luxury, are all
          sought after by this sign. They are slow to anger, but can have
          angry outbursts. Taurus signs look for stability in their lives and
          in their partners and co-workers. Taurus people are generally not
          in a hurry, and it can take them many years to decide what they want
          to do for a living. Many of this sign are drawn to the earth
          and the natural world. Earth signs
          have solid, reputable natures, which coincides with the Earth.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, this sign takes a long time to fully commit to a
          relationship, but once they do they are in it for the long haul.
          Most Taurus males marry for life and are dedicated companions.
          Female Taurus are similar in that once they commit themselves to a
          relationship they are stubborn and slow to leave it.
          However, if Taurus women feel put upon, taken for granted, or
          unappreciated for long enough, they will leave.
