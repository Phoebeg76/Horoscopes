        <p>The symbol for Scorpio is the scorpion. A scorpio person is not
          necessarily aggressive, unless provoked, and in general would rather
          be contemplative. They enjoy being alone and often become annoyed when
          they are around people for too long. Scorpio signs are great secret
          keepers and feel emotions more intensely than other signs. Because of
          this they are good at helping people with their problems. They are
          able to show others the best and the worst in their lives.
        </p>
        <p>Scorpio signs are not fearful individuals and often try things
          that others would not attempt. This is because they become self-aware
          at an earlier age than most signs. They have an inflamed sense of
          justice when it comes to standing up for people. Scorpio signs are
          interested in what makes people tick and often work in fields that
          allow them to study people.
